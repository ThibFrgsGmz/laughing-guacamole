GoogleTest installation folder for the F' framework targeting the Linux platform. Place the "gtest" folder at the root of the fprime installation folder. This is a workaround in case someone is working offline, i.e. does not have access to the URL.

Once copied, replace the string `<absolute_path_to_fprime>` with the absolute path to your personal fprime installation folder.

Enjoy!
